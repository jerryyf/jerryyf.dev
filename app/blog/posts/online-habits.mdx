Long overdue post. Given that researchers discovered [16 billion passwords exposed across Google, Facebook, Apple, and any other service imaginable](https://cybernews.com/security/billions-credentials-exposed-infostealers-data-leak/) recently I thought I should write a bit about improving online habits.

## stop reusing passwords

Use a password manager. Generate complex passwords or passphrases, and save them so you don't have to remember different passwords. Bitwarden or KeePassXC are great open source ones, and they both have extensions for Chrome and Firefox.

## check if your data has ever been leaked

A reputable and well-known service for this is [haveibeenpwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/).

## keep your web browser clean

Like housekeeping for your browser - clear your cookies and cache from time to time. Might be inconvenient to sign into everything again, but most session cookies expire after a certain period anyway.

## use an ad-blocker

I can only recommend [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) - it is lightweight, open source, highly configurable and does more than just ad-blocking - from blocking known malware and trackers to disabling JavaScript. However on Chrome it has been removed from the extension store with [Google declaring war on ad blockers](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2438114/interview-ghostery-explains-why-chrome-is-working-against-ad-blockers.html).
